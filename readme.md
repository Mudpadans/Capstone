The Temple of Shrek

This full-stack application is the main organizational website of the Temple of Shrek, a fictitious religious organization dedicated to Shrek and his companions. The Temple intends to grow and gain more followers, so they made way for visitors to sign up and join their cult. Once users are members, they can take part in events and discussions.

The tech stack for the front end includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Axios; the back end also uses Javascript along with ExpressJS, SQL, and Sequelize.Query.

This website has three main features which include a signup-login form, an event schedule page, and a discussion forum. The signup form will ask users for details about themselves and they sign in with an email; those details will be kept in a database those users can log in with their email. A pop-up will tell users that they've successfully logged in, then they can access the event page and discussion page (which is intentionally blocked from non-members). The event page lists events that were posted first with details such as the date of the event, who posted it, and how many members are going. Users can create posts with a description and delete or update them. The discussion page works in a much similar fashion with text, the user's name, and when the discussion was posted. Additionally, users can reply to other discussions with the reply button and then delete their comments by clicking on it.
